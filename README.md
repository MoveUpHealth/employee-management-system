Purpose: This application allows a company to keep their employment data organized.

The application gives the user various options: add, view, or update. The user can choose to add a department, role, or employee. When adding an employee, the user can indicate a manager for the employee. The user can also choose to view departments, roles, and employees. There is also an option to update an employee's role.

Technologies Used

* Node.js
* inquirer
* mysql

Challenges: There were not any signficant challenges to constructing this app.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to encapsulate inquirer into various functions that could then be used to give the program a seamless flow.

Future Development: In the future, there will be additional features. It will be possible to update employee managers, view employees by manager, delete departments, roles, and employees, and view the total department budget utilization.

## Installation 
 
The user will need to install inquirer and mysql.
